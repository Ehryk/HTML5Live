HTML5Live
=========

An interactive HTML5 website, available at www.htmlfivelive.com

This is a single page HTML5 application, the single page being index.html at the root. It using IIS URL Rewriting to rewrite any non-root url that is missing a . to index.html, and swapr.js does the work of loading the subpage asyncronously and modifying the links to swap sections rather than loading new pages.

It uses HTML5 localStorage to store your version of the controls when the 'Save' button is clicked.
